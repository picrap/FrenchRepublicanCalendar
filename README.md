# French republican calendar

This is probably totally pointless. I did this for fun.  
Available as a [![NuGet Status](http://img.shields.io/nuget/v/FrenchRepublicanCalendar.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FrenchRepublicanCalendar) package.

## How it works

The package exposes two main classes:
* `FrenchRepublicanDateTime`, a `DateTime` with extra properties.
* `FrenchRepublicanCalendar`, a `Calendar` implementation for French Republican calendar.
